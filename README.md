NEW VERSION WITH NAL-6 inference: https://github.com/opennars/OpenNARS-for-Applications/tree/MSC2

**Minimal Sensorimotor Component**

A minimal component supporting:
- Learning from event streams in real time
- Pursuing of multiple goals in parallel

Theory: ANSNA / NARS, especially NAL7/8
It was realized by starting from ANSNA v0.6.0 (see https://github.com/patham9/ANSNA), by removing SDR's and replacing them with atomic terms (and sequences thereof) for events.
